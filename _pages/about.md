Hello and welcome to my page. 

I am a 1st year Ph.D. student with the Large Scale Data & Systems Group at the Department of Computing of the Imperial College London. 

My main supervisor is Prof. Peter Pietzuch and my secondary supervisor is Dr. Paolo Costa from Microsoft Research. My Ph.D. studies are supported by a Ph.D. scholarship from the Department of Computing of the Imperial College London. 

My current research focus is on optimizing communication stacks for distributed deep learning systems and integrating emerging heterogeneous hardware for future data centres. 

Previously, I have received my M.Eng. from the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) of the [National Technical University of Greece](https://www.ntua.gr/en/).
